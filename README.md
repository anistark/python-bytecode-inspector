# Python Bytecode Inspector

A simple web-based tool built using **React** and **Pyodide** that allows users to input Python code, view its **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**, **bytecode**, and **raw bytecode**. This tool helps you understand how Python code is parsed, compiled, and executed at a low level.

## Features

- **AST Viewer**: View the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of your Python code.
- **Bytecode Disassembler**: See the disassembled bytecode of your Python code.
- **Raw Bytecode**: View the raw bytecode as generated by Pythonâ€™s compiler.

## Demo
